Passionate Full Stack Developer/ Educator currently working at Investcloud. Here I create state-of-the-art websites that are used by thousands of clients. When I am not working at Investcloud you can find me teaching a class at General Assembly as a Software Immersive instructor. I help guide students along their path from zero to a software developer. I am always challenging myself and striving to improve my skills by studying the latest software, designing and developing responsive websites.
